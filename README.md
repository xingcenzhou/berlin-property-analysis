# berlin-property-analysis
This hobby project aims to analyze and visualize Berlin's real estate market as of April 2023, then offers purchasing recommendations.

# Background
Berlin is one of my favorate cities in the world. Throughout the years, I have lived in different parts of Berlin; the vast difference in Berlin districts intrigues me, and I decided to make an analysis of Berlin's property market to understand the city better.

# Tools and goals
The project uses Python(Jupyter Notebook) and Tableau, with the goal of answering the following business questions:

1. How do housing prices vary in different districts of Berlin?
2. Berlin has different types of properties – for example, ‘Altbau’ (old/historical building), ‘Neubau’ (new building), and those that were built rapidly a􀅌er the World War II, with a cheap price and bad quality. Are there any price differences in correla􀆟on to the construction year?
3. Which district(s) in Berlin tend to have larger floor area with a lower price?
4. Do the recently constructed properties have a larger area or smaller, are there any correlations?

# Result
The final results are delivered as a Tableau Storyboard.
